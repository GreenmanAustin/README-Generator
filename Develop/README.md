  ## Description

  - I built this project because I wanted to practice using NodeJS to do something potentially useful.  I also wanted to spend more time coding and reduce the time spent on ancillary matters, such as creating README.md files for each project.

  - My project allows a developer to quickly create a quality README.md file with numerous useful details.

  - I learned I learned to use NodeJS, create a CLI program, and use template literals and promises to write better code.
