# README-Generator

  ## Description

  - I built this project because I wanted to practice using NodeJS to do something potentially useful. I also wanted to spend more time coding and reduce the time spent on ancillary matters, such as creating README.md files for each project.

  - My project allows a developer to quickly create a quality README.md file with numerous useful details.

  - I learned to use NodeJS, create a CLI program, and use template literals and promises to write better code.


  ## Installation

  Fork the code from my repository and clone it to your local IDE. Install the dependencies, which in this case is node modules.

  ## Usage

  After installing, type "node index.js" in the command line while in the folder of containing the index.js file. Then answer the prompted questions. The app will generate a README.md file in the root directory.
